#Pull Request
In general, no one works directly on the main branch. Instead, they create a feature branch and make their changes there. Once the changes are completed, they discuss them with other team members. If the changes good and works well, they raise a pull request. After the pull request is reviewed and  good to use, the feature branch is merged into the main branch.
